# GDL (Geometric Description Language)

GDL is a procedural language capable of describing 3D and 2D representations (and many more properties) of parametric Objects in ARCHICAD, an architectural modeling software created by GRAPHISOFT SE. Its reference documentation can be found at: http://gdl.graphisoft.com/reference-guide

# Blockly.GDL

This project aims to adapt Google's Blockly system to the 3D modeling part of the GDL language, and thus provide a visual programming experience for GDL, for educational purposes.
